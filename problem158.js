// Exploring strings for which only one character comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Problem 158 
// Taking three different letters from the 26 letters of the alphabet, character strings of length three can be formed.
// Examples are 'abc', 'hat' and 'zyx'.
// When we study these three examples we see that for 'abc' two characters come lexicographically after its neighbour to 
// the left.
// For 'hat' there is exactly one character that comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left. For 'zyx' there 
// are zero characters that come lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.
// In all there are 10400 strings of length 3 for which exactly one character comes lexicographically after its neighbour 
// to the left.

// We now consider strings of n â‰¤ 26 different characters from the alphabet.
// For every n, p(n) is the number of strings of length n for which exactly one character comes lexicographically after 
// its neighbour to the left.

// What is the maximum value of p(n)?
